# TMDB Movie Information MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects Claude to The Movie Database (TMDB) API, providing real-time information about movies and TV shows.

## üé¨ Features

- **Movie Search**: Search for movies by title and optionally by release year
- **Movie Details**: Get detailed information about specific movies including cast and crew
- **Discover Movies**: Find currently playing, upcoming, and popular movies
- **TV Shows**: Search for TV shows and get popular TV show listings

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- `httpx` for HTTP requests
- `mcp` package for the Model Context Protocol implementation
- TMDB API key (get one for free at [https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api))

## üöÄ Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Navigate to the tmdb directory
cd movieinfo/tmdb

# Create a virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure your API key:

Create a `.env` file in the tmdb directory with your TMDB API key:

```
TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Alternatively, edit the `tmdb.py` file to replace `API_KEY = "<TMDB API KEY>"` with your actual API key, though using environment variables is more secure.

## üîÑ How It Works

1. When Claude needs movie or TV show information, it calls the appropriate tool on this server.
2. The server makes requests to the TMDB API using your API key.
3. The data is formatted into a human-readable format and returned to Claude.
4. Claude can then provide this movie information to the user.

## üîç Troubleshooting

- **"Unable to fetch movie data or no movies found"**: Check that your search term is correct. Try using a more general search term.
- **"Unable to fetch details for movie ID"**: The movie ID may be invalid or no longer available in the TMDB database.
- **API Key Issues**: If all requests are failing, verify that your API key is correctly set and still valid.

## üîß Extending the Server

You can extend this movie information server by:

1. Adding more TMDB API endpoints as new tools (e.g., movie reviews, recommendations)
2. Implementing advanced search filters
3. Adding support for TV show episodes and seasons
